This is an entry for the Gynvael Summer Gamedev Challenge of 2018

Since I am starting super late (2018-8-8) I may miss the deadline. It is still a good challenge though.

src contains the source javascript that will be minified.

js contains the minified javascript.

rc contains the various resources (sprites, sounds, etc...)

index.html is the main web page to load.

run `make` to build the src javascript into the minified javascript that will be delivered to the client.

index.html only accesses files in js and rc.
